## How to Build and Submit an Update to Apple Developer

Follow these steps to build and submit an updated version of your app to the Apple App Store.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. **EAS CLI** installed. If you haven't installed it yet, run:
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli

2. Logged in to your Expo account via EAS CLI:
    ```bash
    eas login

3. Your app configured correctly in eas.json for iOS builds.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Build the iOS App

    
    Run the following command to build your iOS app. This command will trigger a build process in the cloud using the configuration specified in your eas.json file.

    ```bash
    eas build --platform ios

    - This command will create a build for the iOS platform based on the settings defined in the eas.json file.
    - Make sure to review and address any errors or prompts during the build process.

2. Monitor the Build
    - After initiating the build, you can monitor the progress in the terminal or visit the Expo EAS dashboard at EAS Build Dashboard.
    - Once the build is complete, you will receive a URL to download the build artifact (e.g., .ipa file for iOS).

3. Submit the Build to the App Store

    ```bash
    eas submit --platform ios

    - This command will guide you through the submission process.
    - Make sure to have your App Store Connect API Key ready. If you havenâ€™t set up an App Store Connect API Key, you will need to create one and add it to your Expo account.

4. Follow the Submission Process
    
    - Follow the prompts in the terminal to authenticate and configure the submission.
    - EAS CLI will automatically upload your build to Apple App Store Connect.
    - Once the submission is complete, review the status on your App Store Connect dashboard.
